This code is made to asssign the images to the train, validation and test folders.
We have chosen to assign 70% to train and 15% to validation and test, respectively. 

# VI KÃ˜RER FUCKING 70-20-10 VED VORES

We assign the images randomly as we cannot be sure if the images is ordered in a way.
This could be that all the first photos are from a hospital with a new scanner and the rest from 
an older more blurry scanner. As we have no ID on the people from the images we assume 
that the images match a unique person. 

We have chosen to have the most data to train our model. The exact distribution is made from
considerations made on researching the web and from what we have discussed in the lectures.
